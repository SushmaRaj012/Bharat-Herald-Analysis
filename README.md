🌟 Features / Highlights
🔹 Business Problem
Legacy newspapers like Bharat Herald face shrinking circulation, declining ad revenues, and advertiser distrust, while digital adoption remains uneven across cities.

🔹 Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
Identifies cities at highest risk of print decline.
Tracks ad revenue per copy and advertiser ROI.
Highlights digital readiness vs actual engagement gaps.
Provides data-driven strategies for phased digital transition.

🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

Decline Tracker (2019–2024):
Flags year-over-year circulation & revenue declines per city.

Print Efficiency Report:
Compares copies printed vs net circulation → highlights print waste.

Digital Readiness vs Engagement Matrix:
Cross-plots readiness (literacy, internet, smartphone penetration) vs actual engagement.

Ad Revenue per Copy:
Shows profitability differences between large vs niche readership markets.

Risk & Health Index:
Combines print decline & digital readiness to rank cities by priority for digital relaunch.

🔹 Business Impact & Insights

📉 Print Reality Check: Varanasi & Jaipur show the largest absolute print waste (~3M+ copies gap).

💰 Revenue Insights: Cities like Patna & Lucknow earn the most per copy (₹16–20), proving small markets can be high value.
